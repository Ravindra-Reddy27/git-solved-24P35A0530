# System Architecture

## Overview
DevOps Simulator follows a microservices architecture designed for high availability and scalability. This document covers production and development configurations. Experimental architecture details are included separately and are disabled by default.

## Components

### 1. Application Server
- Technology: Node.js + Express
- Production Port: 8080
- Development Port: 3000
- Scaling: Horizontal auto-scaling (production only)
- Development Features: Hot reload, debug mode

### 2. Database Layer
- Database: PostgreSQL 14
- Production: Master-slave replication with automated backups
- Development: Single local instance with seed data

### 3. Monitoring System
- Production: Prometheus + Grafana with email alerts
- Development: Console logging with verbose output
- Metrics: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network

## Deployment Strategy

### Production
- Method: Rolling updates
- Zero-downtime: Yes
- Rollback: Automated on failure
- Region: us-east-1

### Development
- Method: Docker Compose
- Features: Hot reload, instant feedback
- Testing: Automated tests before deployment

## Security
- Production: SSL/TLS encryption, strict access controls
- Development: Relaxed security for easier debugging

## Experimental Architecture (Disabled by Default)

This section describes an alternative event-driven and AI-enhanced architecture. It is not enabled by default and is not considered production-ready. It must be explicitly activated through the feature flag `experimental_mode = true`.

### Overview
This architecture introduces AI/ML-driven scaling, distributed data systems, and multi-cloud resiliency. It is intended for research and performance experimentation.

### Core Components

#### 1. Application Server (AI-Enhanced)
- Technology: Node.js + Express + TensorFlow.js
- Ports: 9000 (main), 9001 (metrics), 9002 (AI API)
- Scaling: Predictive auto-scaling powered by ML models
- Message Queue: Apache Kafka for event streaming and service communication

#### 2. Distributed Database Layer
- Primary: PostgreSQL 14 cluster with multiple nodes
- Cache: Redis cluster with learning-based cache optimization
- Replication: Multi-master configuration
- Backup: Continuous geo-redundant backups
- AI Features: Index suggestion and query optimization

#### 3. AI/ML Pipeline
- Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- Models:
  - Anomaly detection
  - Load prediction
  - Reinforcement learning auto-scaling controller
- Training Method: Continuous online learning
- Inference: Low-latency real-time prediction

#### 4. Multi-Cloud Orchestration
- Supported Providers: AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean
- Orchestrator: Kubernetes with custom resource definitions
- Load Balancing: Global anycast routing
- Failover: Automatic cross-region recovery

#### 5. Advanced Monitoring and Observability
- Metrics: Prometheus with long-term storage support
- Logging: ELK Stack with machine-learning-assisted analysis

### Notes
- Experimental architecture is documented but not active
- Production features remain unaffected
- Switching to the experimental architecture requires an explicit configuration change
